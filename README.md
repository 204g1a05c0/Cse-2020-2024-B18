# IOT Based Accident Detection System and Monitoring Driver Drowsiness
Abstract 
This project introduces a modern system that uses IoT technology which bring together accident detection and monitoring for driver drowsiness. Arduino serves as the central processing unit, facilitating the integration of sensors for real-time alerts regarding potential accidents and driver fatigue. The primary objectives encompass the design and implementation of a robust hardware and software infrastructure. OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library, is employed for real-time face detection to monitor driver drowsiness patterns.     
    In response to the pressing concern of road safety, the main focus of the project is to create accurate algorithms for detecting accidents and to establish fast systems that send alerts. These systems will deal with potential dangers from the surroundings and risks associated with the driver.
