# Deep Learning Based Object Detection for Autonomous Drones
Abstract 
This project explores the integration of advanced deep learning techniques into autonomous drones for object detection. Object detection plays a vital role in enabling drones to perceive and interact intelligently with their surroundings. The process involves data collection, selecting appropriate deep learning architectures, and fine-tuning models for accurate detection. By utilizing  transfer learning, pretrained models are adapted to drone-specific scenarios.
  The trained models efficiently predict object presence in real-time imagery. We gather pictures, choose good computer methods, and teach them to find things. Challenges such as real-time processing and varied environmental conditions are addressed. Ultimately, this project aims to enhance drone autonomy and safety with the help of deep learning-based object detection technology.
